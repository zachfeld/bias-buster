# bias-buster
news suggestion application for Hackathon 2019

# News is hard...
More often than not, the news we consume on a daily basis is full 
of misleading facts and figures. This web application's primary 
goal is to help people assess the reliability of the news they consume.
Using a machine learning API, We attribute a value from 0 to 1 that 
measures the level of bias in both the articles title and content.
We then take keywords from the content of the article and use the NYT
article search API to suggest similar articles. While we understand there
is no perfect source of news, we hope to help people base their arguments and opinions
on facts as opposed to noise and misdirection.
